I like building things for the web.

You might’ve seen [CodeCafé](https://github.com/mrktsm/codecafe), a collaborative browser-based code editor I’ve been working on.

Check out the [project](https://github.com/mrktsm/codecafe), try the [demo](https://codecafe.app/), or visit my [site](https://markotsymbaluk.com/) if you're curious.

You can also connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marko-tsymbaliuk/).
